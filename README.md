The aim of this project is to develop and train a model that can analyze tweets and determine whether they are truly related to a disaster. This project is part of Kaggle's "Getting Started" competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview) and serves as a mini project for CU Boulderâ€™s DTSA 5511 course. The primary objective is to introduce NLP concepts rather than optimizing for the highest-performing model through multiple iterations.
